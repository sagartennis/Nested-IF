# Nested-IF

A nested If statement means an IF statement inside another IF condition. Let's take this real-life example for instance. 

You want to go out and buy groceries during the Lockdown period. Then you want to ask if there is enough stock of groceries or not. Here, as we can see there is a nested if condition used. 

The first If statement will ask the user: if he is allowed to go outside. If the answer is yes, the program will go to the second If statement which questions if groceries are empty or not. 

Both If statements must be closed with an else statement for all the false cases.

PROBLEM 

Ask the program if lockdown allows you to go outside. The second If statement must ask If the groceries are over.
